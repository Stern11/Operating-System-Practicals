Hey, This is Aryan Pratap.
This program would copy content of this file to "file2.txt".

When this program would start to execute it would transform into a 
process.

Interrupts : Interrupts are the process which have the highest priority 
    to execute. When an interrupt is generated it stops the currently
running process and start to execute.
After handling this interrupt previous process can continue to 
execute.
